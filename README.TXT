PROJECT TITLE: Dijkstra Algorithm in Java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Solution of formative assignment
VERSION or DATE: due 12 October 2011
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: XXX
AUTHOR: Jan Minar <rdancer@rdancer.org>
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

Objective A
***********
Use the Graph class constructor to create an adjacency matrix representation of a graph.
Two constructors are provided: one that takes a String, and another one that takes a File.

The adjacency matrix representation is accessible via the adjacencyMatrix() method.  A textual
representation of the adjacency matrix forms the bulk of the toString() method output.

The test unit test methods Test.testNewGraphFromFile() and Test.testNewGraphFromString() show the working
of these constructors in action.
